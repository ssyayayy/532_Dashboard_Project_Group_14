## Welcome!
Welcome to our dashboard! 

Thank you for visiting the Attrition app project repository.

This document (the README file) is going to offer you some information about the project. We are very excited to show you what we have here!

## What are we doing?

### The problem

Companies usually spend a large amount of money on training new employees every year. Whenever there is a turnover, it is costly to go through the hiring and training process. Therefore, employee loyalty is one the important things that management team should draw attention to. It is very useful to uncover the factors contribute to employee attrition. 

### The solution

To address this challenge, we propose building a data visualization app that offers the management team to visually explore the dataset of employee attrition to identify common factors. Our app will show whether the employee choose to quit and allow users to filter different variables in order to better explore and compare the factors that lead to attrition.

## Motivation

We designed this app based on the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance. Our target audience is the IBM Management Team. By navigating through the dashboard, it can help the management team observe the key contributors for attrition with guidance of a direction to improve employee retention and prevent attrition in the future.

## Description of app

This app shows the 4 key factors that may contribute to employee attrition based on IBM employee satisfaction survey data. The 4 key factors (`monthly income`, `business travel frequency`, etc) are showed with the distribution by attrition status using box plot and bar charts. From a dropdown list, users can filter out  `department` and/or `gender` because these variables may have different degree of impacts on attrition.  There is also a slider allowing users specify range of `age` for employees based on users' interests. By exploring the distribution charts and different variable filter options, users will be able to look into the impact of these factors on attrition and identify potential high risk employee segments, and hopefully these finding will be beneficial to users so that they can develop employee retention strategies to reduce attrition rate.
